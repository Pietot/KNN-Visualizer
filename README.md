## 1 - Features

- The algorithm is visualized in real time, so you can see how it works

- You can change the number of neighbors (k) and the number of points dynamically with the wheel (not on mobile)

- You chan choose between 2, 3, 4 or 5 classes

- You can choose between 10, 50 or 100 points

- Show the background with all the predictions

- Change the position of the points without reloading the page
